  # Named folders makes sense for generated/output folders because you may want
  # more than one type of location to generate output.
  #
  # Don't confuse multiple named output folders with sub-paths, when you want to
  # build up a file name in a child folder, you can do that as part of building
  # the filename.
  #
  # The idea behind named folders is for when you have two or more totally different
  # outputs that (may live in the a similar location) or live in different locations.

  # Layered folders allow files to be found in any of the searchable folders
  #
  # They derive from and thus work just like named folders in that they allow folders
  # to be stored with easy to remember names/alias's.
  #
  # Where they differ is that they are retrieved in preferential search order that is
  # by default (First In, Last Out) priority aka a Stack (Last In, First Out) or
  # optionally over ridden via the search_order method
  #
  # Layered folders makes sense for use with template files and source data/model
  # where you can have specific usage files available and if they are not found then
  # you can use fall-back files in other folders.
  #
  # example:
  #   folders = LayeredFolders.new
  #   folders.add(:global       , '~/global_templates')
  #   folders.add(:domain       , '/my-project/domain_templates')
  #   folders.add(:app          , '/my-project/my-app/.templates')
  #
  #   # Find a file and folder will in folders in this order
  #   # app_templates, then domain_templates and then finally global templates
  #   # ['/my-project/my-app/.templates', '/my-project/domain_templates', '~/global_templates']
  #   #
  #   # Find a file called template1.txt and return its fully-qualified path
  #   folders.find_file('template1.txt')
  #
  #   # As above, but returns the folder only, file name and sub-paths are ignored
  #   folders.find_file_folder('template1.txt')
  #   folders.find_file_folder('abc/xyz/deep-template.txt')
  #
  #   # If an additional folder is added, say in child configuration that is designed
  #   # to override some of the global templates, then you can run a search_order
  #   # method to re-order the templates
  #
  #   folders.add(:global_shim  , '~/global_templates_shim')
  #   folders.search_order(:app, :domain, :global_shim, :global)
